# Notes françaises
I'm currently self-studying French (with the help of Kwiziq and the occasional class at Alliance Française de Singapour), and I thought it would be a good idea to make notes in preparation for the DELF exams. The vast majority of these notes will be on conjugation, grammar, and vocabulary.
